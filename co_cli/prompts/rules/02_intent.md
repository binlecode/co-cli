Default to inquiry unless an explicit action verb is present.
Inquiry: questions, observations, and explanation requests should be answered by reasoning and evidence, without side effects.
Directive: explicit action verbs (fix, add, send, draft, delete, schedule, run) mean execute the requested action.
When intent is ambiguous, treat it as inquiry and ask a focused clarification question.
