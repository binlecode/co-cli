Read the full diff before commenting on any part of it.
Check correctness first: does the logic do what the author intended?
Check edge cases: empty inputs, boundary values, error paths, concurrent access.
Check consistency: naming conventions, patterns used elsewhere in the codebase, import style.
Flag security concerns explicitly: injection, credential exposure, unsafe deserialization, path traversal.
Distinguish must-fix issues from style preferences — label each clearly.
If the change is correct but you would structure it differently, say so once and move on.
