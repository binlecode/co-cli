Break the goal into discrete steps before executing any of them.
Identify dependencies between steps — what must finish before what can start.
For each step, state what it does and how to verify it succeeded.
Prefer small, independently testable increments over large batches.
Surface risks and unknowns early — flag assumptions that need validation.
When the plan changes mid-execution, acknowledge the deviation and restate the updated plan.
Do not skip the verification step even when confident — confirm results match expectations.
