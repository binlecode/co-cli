# Co CLI — Skills

> Sibling surfaces: [memory.md](memory.md) · [personality.md](personality.md) · [tools.md](tools.md). Bootstrap (when skills load): [bootstrap.md](bootstrap.md). Per-turn skill-env lifecycle: [core-loop.md](core-loop.md). Dispatch discipline: [06_skill_protocol.md](../../co_cli/context/rules/06_skill_protocol.md).

Skills are procedural capability — name-addressable workflows injected as prompt overlays. They are distinct from memory (declarative state), tools (callable primitives), and personality (doctrine). Dispatching a skill does not register a new tool; it expands a body string into the main agent for a normal LLM turn.

## 1. Functional Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SkillFile["SKILL.md (in skill folder)"] --> Loader["load_skills"]
    Loader --> Registry["deps.skill_catalog\n+ get_skill_catalog()"]
    Registry --> Dispatch["name args"]
    Dispatch --> AgentBody["expanded skill body"]
    AgentBody --> MainLoop["main.py"]
    MainLoop --> MainAgent["main Agent"]
    MainAgent --> Tools["existing tools"]
```

### Components

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `load_skills` | Two-pass loader — bundled then user-global; security scan applied to user-global only |
| `deps.skill_catalog` | Full skill registry (`dict[str, SkillInfo]`); used by slash-command dispatch |
| `get_skill_catalog()` | Model-facing subset — excludes hidden skills; source for `<available_skills>` manifest |
| `render_skill_manifest()` | Renders `<available_skills>` XML block; emitted per-turn via `skill_manifest_prompt` so newly created skills are visible on the next turn |
| `dispatch(raw_input, ctx)` | Routes slash commands — built-ins first, then `skill_catalog`, then error |
| `refresh_skills(deps)` | Hot-reload: re-loads both tiers, replaces `deps.skill_catalog`; called by the skill write tools and `/skills reload` |
| `skill_create` / `skill_edit` / `skill_patch` / `skill_delete` | Model-callable write tools — one monomorphic tool per operation |
| `skill_view` | Model-callable reader — returns full skill body inline |

### Entry Points

Startup: `create_deps()` in `co_cli/bootstrap/core.py` calls `load_skills()` during deps assembly.

Per-turn: `main.py` saves current env for keys in `skill_env`, calls `os.environ.update(skill_env)`, runs the turn, and restores previous values in a `finally` block.

## 2. Core Logic

### Invocation Paths

Skills are reached through three distinct paths:

**Path 1 — User slash-command.**
The user types `/skill-name [args]` in the REPL. `dispatch()` matches the name in `skill_catalog`, expands the body (argument substitution), and returns `DelegateToAgent`. The REPL then calls `run_turn()` with the expanded body as the user input — a full new agent turn. The skill body replaces the user's input for that turn; the model never sees the raw `/skill-name` string.

**Path 2 — Model inline use.**
The agent reads the `<available_skills>` manifest injected per-turn into the system prompt, identifies a matching skill, and calls `skill_view(name)` to load the full body. The body is returned as a tool result inside the current turn. The agent reads it and follows its phases as its procedure — no new turn, no dispatch, no REPL involvement. This is the primary path for agent-initiated skill use.

**Path 3 — Model write.**
The agent calls `skill_create`, `skill_edit`, `skill_patch`, or `skill_delete` to write a user skill. Used for drift fixes (stale steps), promoting a reusable procedure to a new skill, or removing an obsolete one. Each tool requires approval, runs the security scan, and calls `refresh_skills(deps)` on success so the change is live immediately. All four skill-write tools are DEFERRED (skill writes are rare and deliberate) and loaded on demand via `tool_view` (by exact name) before the call — the agent stays aware of them through the per-turn deferred-tool stub.

The dream daemon's domain reviewers also write via the skill write tools (`skill_create`/`skill_edit`/`skill_patch` — not `skill_delete`) and the memory write tools (`memory_create`/`memory_append`/`memory_replace`) — they run in daemon-built `CoDeps` via `build_task_agent` with `requires_approval=False`. They are extensions of Path 3, not separate paths.

### Skill Model

`SkillInfo` in `co_cli/skills/skill_types.py`:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | slash-command name derived from the parent directory name |
| `description` | listing text shown in `/skills` and exposed via `get_skill_catalog()` |
| `body` | prompt body injected into the main agent on dispatch |
| `argument_hint` | UI hint for `/help` and `/skills` |
| `user_invocable` | whether the skill appears as a slash command |
| `disable_model_invocation` | hide from `get_skill_catalog()` results and manifest |
| `skill_env` | env vars injected for the duration of the dispatched turn |
| `path` | absolute path to the skill's `SKILL.md` on disk; `None` for programmatic configs |

### File Format

Every skill is a directory `<name>/` containing a `SKILL.md` entry file; the directory name is the authoritative skill name. The `SKILL.md` is parsed with `parse_frontmatter()` from `co_cli/memory/frontmatter.py`. Sibling files/dirs in the folder (`scripts/`, `references/`) are ignored by discovery (the loader globs only `*/SKILL.md`); a `scripts/` asset is not loaded but may be driven at runtime via `shell_exec` — see Bundled Executable Assets below. Built-in slash commands are reserved and cannot be shadowed.

| Frontmatter Field | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `description` | human-readable summary (required) |
| `argument-hint` | argument usage hint |
| `user-invocable` | include in slash-command completer and `/help` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | hide from `get_skill_catalog()` and manifest |
| `skill-env` | turn-scoped env injection, filtered through `_SKILL_ENV_BLOCKED` |

### Bundled Executable Assets

A skill folder may ship an **executable asset** alongside its `SKILL.md` — a script the skill body drives at runtime through `shell_exec`, never imported into the agent process (subprocess isolation). The `documents` skill is the first: `co_cli/skills/documents/scripts/extract_pdf.py` extracts a local PDF to markdown via the `co-extract-pdf` command. Conventions for any skill-bundled script:

- **Exposed as a `[project.scripts]` console entry point**, not `uv run python -m`. The skill body invokes the bare command (e.g. `co-extract-pdf <path>`). This is a runtime constraint, not a preference: `shell_exec` spawns with a sanitized allowlist env (`co_cli/tools/shell_env.py` — `PATH` propagates, `VIRTUAL_ENV`/`PYTHONPATH` do not) and `cwd` set to the user's `workspace_dir`, so only a `PATH`-resolved console command resolves `co_cli` reliably on a dev checkout and an installed wheel alike. The skill folder and its `scripts/` dir carry docstring-only `__init__.py` so the entry-point module path import-resolves.
- **Lives under `co_cli/` and obeys the full `co_cli/` ruff ruleset** — notably T20: output goes through `sys.stdout.write`/`sys.stderr.write`, never `print` (the per-file-ignores that exempt `evals/`/`scripts/`/`tests/` do not cover `co_cli/skills/*/scripts/`).
- **Approval semantics** — the first run prompts (the command is not in `DEFAULT_SHELL_SAFE_COMMANDS`). A `shell.safe_commands` opt-in auto-approves only the bare command; `shell_policy.py`'s path-traversal guard rejects any arg containing `/`, `~`, or `..`, so only a workspace-root bare path auto-approves. The practical ergonomic win is session-subject auto-approval: once approved this session, the same subject is not re-prompted.

### Load Order

```
create_deps()
  ├─ Pass 1: load bundled skills from co_cli/skills/*/SKILL.md
  │    no security scan (version-controlled)
  └─ Pass 2: load user-global skills from ~/.co-cli/skills/*/SKILL.md
       security scan applied
       name collision → user-global overrides bundled
```

### Load Safety

**Containment.** For user-global skills, symlinks are rejected outright — only regular files are loaded. Symlink files are skipped with a warning. Bundled skills are not checked.

**Security scan.** `scan_skill_content()` runs static regex checks on every user-global file at startup and on `/skills reload`. Warning classes: credential exfiltration, curl/wget piped to shell, destructive shell fragments, prompt-injection text. Findings are warnings — the file still loads.

`skill-env` is filtered through `_SKILL_ENV_BLOCKED`, which prevents overriding `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, `HOME`, and shell-loader variables.

### Dispatch

Skill dispatch is the third branch of `dispatch()` (after built-ins and before unknown-command error). Full routing lives in `tui.md`; this section covers the skill branch only.

```
name matched in ctx.deps.skill_catalog
  body = skill.body
  if args non-empty AND "$ARGUMENTS" in body:
    args_list = args.split()           # whitespace-split positional args
    body = body.replace("$ARGUMENTS", args)   # raw argument string
    body = body.replace("$0", name)           # skill name
    for i, arg in reversed(enumerate(args_list, 1)):
      body = body.replace(f"${i}", arg)       # $1, $2, ... positional
  # else: body used as-is (no args or no $ARGUMENTS token in body)
  return DelegateToAgent(
    delegated_input=body,
    skill_env=dict(skill.skill_env),   # copy of filtered env vars
    skill_name=skill.name,             # stored as deps.runtime.active_skill_name by caller
  )
```

Positional replacements iterate in reverse order so `$1` does not partially match `$10`, `$11`, etc.

### Argument Expansion

| Token | Replacement | Condition |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` | raw argument string (unsplit) | only when args non-empty and token present in body |
| `$0` | skill name | same |
| `$1`, `$2`, ... | whitespace-split positional args | same; missing positionals left as literal `$N` |

If no arguments are passed, or the body contains no `$ARGUMENTS` token, the body is used verbatim.

### Skill Env Lifecycle

```
main.py — per-turn
  saved = {k: os.environ.get(k) for k in skill_env}
  os.environ.update(skill_env)
  try:
    run_turn()
  finally:
    restore saved values (delete keys not previously present)
    clear deps.runtime.active_skill_name
```

### Skill Management Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/skills list` | show loaded skills |
| `/skills check` | compare available files vs loaded skills across both tiers; report skip reasons |
| `/skills lint [<name>\|--all]` | run R1–R4 advisory lint rules; exit 1 on any finding |
| `/skills reload` | rescan user-global directory and reload into live session |
| `/skills usage [<name>]` | print the per-skill usage sidecar (table for all; full record for one) |
| `/skills pin <name>` | pin an agent-created skill — exempt from dream-daemon skill decay/merge |
| `/skills unpin <name>` | clear the pinned flag |

`/skills reload` rescans only the user-global directory. `/skills check` covers both tiers.

### Authoring Contract

Every skill body has this minimum shape:

```markdown
---
description: <single sentence: when to use this skill, max 1024 chars>
argument-hint: <optional, max 80 chars>
user-invocable: true
---

# <Skill name>

<body — whatever structure fits the skill>
```

Section requirements:

| Section | Required | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Frontmatter `description` | Yes | ≤1024 chars; drives manifest injection |
| H1 title | Yes | First non-frontmatter heading |
| Body content | Yes | Whatever structure best fits the skill |

Length budget:

| Scope | Limit | Enforcement |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Frontmatter `description` | ≤1024 chars | Hard — `_validate_skill_content` blocks the write |
| Total content | ≤50,000 chars | Hard — `_validate_skill_content` blocks the write |
| Body | ≤8000 chars | Soft — R4 lint warning ("consider splitting") |

Recommended structure for multi-step procedural skills (template, not requirement):

```markdown
## Phase 1 — <Accomplishment name>
<step-by-step instructions>

## Phase N — <Accomplishment name>
...

## Rules
- <terminal invariant>
```

Phase headers use H2 with integer N, em-dash (` — `), and a name describing what the phase **accomplishes** (e.g. `Phase 1 — Load`, not `Phase 1 — First steps`). Short skills, reference tables, and quick-action skills do not need this structure.

Style: imperative voice (`Run X`, `Check Y`), concrete tool names in backticks, no filler. `## Rules` entries are invariants, not steps.

### Lint Rules

Four advisory rules surfaced by `/skills lint` and attached to `skill_create`/`skill_edit`/`skill_patch` success output as `lint_warnings`. Each finding is `R<n>: <message>`; lint never blocks a write.

| Rule | Check | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| **R1** | Frontmatter present | Loader rejects files without frontmatter |
| **R2** | `description` present, non-empty, ≤ 1024 chars | Missing description = invisible in manifest; long descriptions bloat manifest and degrade prompt cache hit rates |
| **R3** | H1 title present after frontmatter | Anchors skill identity in `skill_view` output |
| **R4** | Body ≤ 8000 chars (warning) | Long bodies signal overly broad skills that should be split; the hard cap is 50,000 chars |

One additional gate for the shipped reference library only (run from `tests/test_flow_skill_bundled_library.py`):

| Rule | Check | Scope |
|------|-------|-------|
| **B1** | No `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `XXX` markers | `co_cli/skills/*/SKILL.md` only |

Lint is collaborative — it catches well-meaning skills that won't perform well. The security scan (`scan_skill_content`) is adversarial — it catches actively malicious content. Integrity rules (frontmatter integrity, description present and ≤1024, total content ≤100k) block the write via `_validate_skill_content`; lint never blocks; security scan blocks on findings at write time.

### Curation & Self-Improvement

Three in-session reflexes govern skill quality during a task:

- **Drift fix**: when a loaded skill has stale steps, patch immediately via `skill_patch` for surgical edits or `skill_edit` for structural overhauls.
- **Create**: after completing a multi-step task (3+ coherent steps), if the procedure is class-level reusable, promote it to a skill. Bar: "would I run this again for the same kind of task" — not one-offs.
- **Offer-to-save**: after iterative work where no skill was loaded, briefly offer skill creation before invoking `skill_create`.

**Dream daemon reviewers.** After every `review_memory_nudge_interval` turns (memory domain) or `review_skill_nudge_interval` LLM iterations (skill domain), the REPL writes a KICK file to `$CO_HOME/daemons/dream/queue/` and nudges the dream daemon over a Unix socket. The daemon dequeues work, loads the session transcript up to the queued message count, and runs the appropriate domain reviewer agent via `build_task_agent` with `requires_approval=False`.

```
memory_reviewer (KICK: domain=memory)
  ├─ extract user preferences, rules, and references from transcript
  ├─ create or update memory items for durable user facts
  └─ does not write skills

skill_reviewer (KICK: domain=skill)
  ├─ scan transcript for skill drift, corrections, and new reusable procedures
  ├─ patch or create skills as appropriate
  └─ does not write memory persona items
```

Both reviewer domains are triggered at session end regardless of counter state. KICK files are durable — the daemon picks them up on next start if it was down. Failed reviews (after `max_retry_attempts` timeouts) move to `$CO_HOME/daemons/dream/queue/failed/`.

The skill reviewer reloads skills from disk before its pass so it sees prior writes within the session.

Curation preference order: update a skill loaded in the current session → update an existing umbrella skill → create a new class-level skill only if nothing applicable exists.

**Dream-daemon skill housekeeping.** The dream daemon also runs scheduled-tick `merge_skills` and `decay_skills` phases against `user_skills_dir` — full mechanics in [dream.md §2.5](dream.md). Skill merge clusters similar user-skill bodies (token-Jaccard ≥ `skills.consolidation_similarity_threshold`), picks the highest-recall canonical, and LLM-merges the cluster into the anchor; sibling skill folders move to `user_skills_dir/.archive/<name>/`. Skill decay archives user skills whose sidecar `created_at` is older than `skills.decay_after_days` AND whose most recent `recall_days` entry is older than `skills.recall_protection_days` (or whose `recall_days` is empty). Pinned skills (`/skills pin <name>`) and skills without a sidecar are exempt. Restoration from `.archive/` is a manual `mv` for now — there is no slash-command surface.

**Usage sidecar.** `~/.co-cli/skills/<name>/SKILL.usage.json` (one file per agent-created skill, inside the skill folder so folder deletion is self-cleaning) tracks per-skill counters (`use_count`, `view_count`, `patch_count`), timestamps (`created_at`, `last_used_at`, `last_viewed_at`, `last_patched_at`), `pinned`, and `recall_days` (list of ISO-date strings recording which days the skill was recalled — deduped, updated by `skill_view` and `/<skill>` slash dispatch). Sidecar I/O is best-effort: failures are logged and swallowed so tracking never blocks the underlying tool. Populated only for skills in `user_skills_dir` — bundled skills are excluded.

| `REVIEW_MAX_ITERATIONS` | — | `8` | Max LLM request budget per reviewer pass (code constant in `co_cli/config/skills.py`) |

### Paths

| Path | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `deps.skills_dir` | package directory `co_cli/skills/` | bundled skills (lowest priority) |
| `deps.user_skills_dir` | `~/.co-cli/skills/` | user-global skills (overrides bundled on name collision) |
| `~/.co-cli/skills/<name>/SKILL.usage.json` | `co_cli/skills/usage.py` | per-skill usage sidecar (counters, timestamps, `pinned`, `recall_days`); lives inside the skill folder |
| `~/.co-cli/skills/.archive/<name>/` | `co_cli/daemons/dream/_housekeeping.py` | archived skill folders moved here by dream-daemon skill merge/decay |

## 4. Public Interface

### Model-callable tools

The skills channel exposes four monomorphic write tools — one per operation, all in
`co_cli/tools/system/skills.py`, all `approval=True`. `name` is required on every one; an
invalid name (not matching `[a-z0-9_-]+`, ≤64 chars) is rejected before dispatch.

| Tool | Subject | Behaviour |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `skill_create(name, content)` | `tool:skill_create:<name>` | Create `<name>/SKILL.md` under `user_skills_dir` (making the folder); reject if exists; validate frontmatter (`description` required, ≤1024 chars); security scan; rollback removes the folder on flag; reload. |
| `skill_edit(name, content)` | `tool:skill_edit:<name>` | Full rewrite of an existing user-installed skill; validate + scan + rollback on flag; reload. |
| `skill_patch(name, old_string, new_string, replace_all=False)` | `tool:skill_patch:<name>` | Find-and-replace within a skill body; `replace_all=False` enforces exactly one match; scan + rollback; reload. |
| `skill_delete(name)` | `tool:skill_delete:<name>` | Remove a user-installed skill's whole `<name>/` folder (sidecar included); reload; returns `shadowed_bundled=true` when a bundled skill of the same name becomes active. |

`skill_edit`, `skill_patch`, and `skill_delete` reject bundled-only skills ("copy to `~/.co-cli/skills/` first"). After every successful write, `refresh_skills(deps)` re-loads and re-indexes so the change is immediately dispatchable.

#### `skill_view(name)`

Returns a skill's full body, addressed by the skill name (the skill's directory name) from the manifest. `spill_threshold_chars=inf` — body always lands inline regardless of size.

### Loader and registry
